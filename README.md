Onion Architecture: (Yes/No) 
 
Have you heard of the Onion Architecture principle in software design?
 No
 
 
MVC Pattern: (Yes/No) 
 
Are you familiar with the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern for building web applications?
 Yes
 
 
Web API: (Yes/No) 
 
Do you understand the concept of building RESTful APIs using ASP.NET Core Web API?
 Yes
 
 

Application & Bottlenecks:
Onion Architecture:
 
 
Benefits: (1-3 keywords)
Briefly list some key benefits of using Onion Architecture in .NET Core projects. (e.g., separation of concerns, testability)
 Benefits:

Separation of concerns
Testability
Maintainability
 
 
 
Bottlenecks (Encountered): (Yes/No and Briefly Explain)
Have you encountered any challenges with Onion Architecture in your projects? If so, briefly describe the bottleneck(s). (e.g., Increased complexity for simple projects, difficulty finding developers familiar with the pattern)
 Yes, I have encountered challenges with Onion Architecture. A core problem is that it treats the domain as a single, opaque block, which can increase complexity for simple projects and make it difficult to find developers familiar with the pattern.
 
 

MVC:
 
 
Components: (1-3 keywords each)
Briefly describe the roles of the Model, View, and Controller in the MVC pattern.
 
 Components:

Model: Data handling
View: Presentation
Controller: Coordination
 
 
Bottlenecks (Encountered): (Yes/No and Briefly Explain)
Have you encountered any challenges with tight coupling between Model and Controller in MVC projects? If so, briefly describe the issue(s). (e.g., Difficulty in unit testing controllers, logic changes rippling through the application)
 Yes, I have encountered challenges with tight coupling between Model and Controller in MVC projects. The primary issues include:

A change in one module usually forces a ripple effect of changes in other modules.
Assembly of modules might require more effort and/or time due to the increased inter-module dependency.
A particular module might be harder to reuse and/or test because dependent modules must be included.
 
 

Web API:
Differences from MVC: (Yes/No and Briefly Explain)
 
Can you differentiate between traditional MVC applications and Web APIs? Briefly explain the main difference.
 Yes, I can differentiate between traditional MVC applications and Web APIs. We can use MVC to create a web application that responds with both data and views, while Web API is used to create HTTP services that only respond with data. The Web API request traces actions based on HTTP methods (e.g., GET, POST), whereas MVC requests trace actions based on action names.
 
 
 
Bottlenecks (Encountered): (Yes/No and Briefly Explain)

Have you encountered any performance challenges with traditional MVC applications compared to Web APIs? If so, briefly describe the scenario(s). (e.g., Frequent page refreshes causing performance overhead, complex data exchange requiring a more lightweight approach)
 Yes, I have encountered performance challenges with traditional MVC applications compared to Web APIs. Traditional MVC applications often face performance overhead due to frequent page refreshes and the need for complex data exchanges, which require a more lightweight approach provided by Web APIs. Additionally, the structure of Web APIs can make it harder to locate specific folders like the application or model folder, differing from traditional MVC applications.
